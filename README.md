# Work-Google-Auto
A python script that scrapes my Urban Air work schedule from Optim8.com and then integrates with Google Calendar. I used selenium to access the scheduling site, then used beautiful soup to parse the html data. I used Google Calendar's Python Quickstart guide to create the events according to the data. 

# Installation
To install the dependencies run the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt
